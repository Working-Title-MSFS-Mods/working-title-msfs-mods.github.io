# Working Title G3000 v0.7.2

### Release Highlights
- Added support for advisory VNAV guidance. The FMS can now calculate VNAV descent profiles and provide information on top of descent, bottom of descent, required vertical speed, and vertical path deviation. The autopilot still does not support V PATH mode.
- Enabled entry of custom VNAV altitude restrictions for approach legs in the active flight plan.
- Added measurement unit options (gallons, liters, pounds, kilograms) for fuel display fields. (Note that these do not apply to EICAS).
- Fixed a bug that prevented editing of the active flight plan under certain circumstances (specifically if you start a flight from the world map after you select a procedure, then delete the origin/destination tied to that procedure without first removing the procedure).

**Fixes**
- \[FPLN\] Fixed a bug that prevented editing of the active flight plan under certain circumstances.
- \[PFD\] Autopilot display now correctly shows ALTS armed indication while in PITCH mode.
- \[NavMap\] Flight Plan Text Inset now displays cumulative ETE instead of leg ETE when CUM mode is selected.
