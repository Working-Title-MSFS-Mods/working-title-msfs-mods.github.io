# Working Title G3000 v0.7.2

### Release Highlights
- Added support for advisory VNAV guidance. The FMS can now calculate VNAV descent profiles and provide information on top of descent, bottom of descent, required vertical speed, and vertical path deviation. The autopilot still does not support V PATH mode.

**Fixes**
- \[FPLN\] Fixed a bug that prevented editing of the active flight plan under certain circumstances.
- \[PFD\] Autopilot display now correctly shows ALTS armed indication while in PITCH mode.
- \[NavMap\] Flight Plan Text Inset now displays cumulative ETE instead of leg ETE when CUM mode is selected.
