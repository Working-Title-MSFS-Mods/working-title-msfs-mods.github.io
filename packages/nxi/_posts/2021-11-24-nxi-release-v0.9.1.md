# Working Title Garmin G1000 NXi v0.9.1

## Issues Resolved
* Fixed map flicker/freeze/incorrect range caused by opening the information pages.
* Fixed inability to use outer FMS knob in waypoint input ICAO field on information pages.
* Fixed Activate VTF not switching CDI source in some cases.
* Fixed the NXi not displaying the selected altitude on the altimeter in the PC-6.
* LNAV will now enter SUSP mode when it would otherwise immediately sequence past a leg that was just manually activated.
* Fixed an issue where activating an approach would fail to activate except after multiple activations.
* Fixed an issue where the activate leg dialog would display the incorrect leg information for FAF legs in non-VTF approaches.
* Fixed an issue where GPS values were being written to the sim in incorrect unit types (feet for altitude and knots for speed).
* Nearest VOR page no longer mislabeled as "Nearest NDB".
* Fixed minor regression in drawing the baseline of horizontal EIS gauges.

## Heads Up!
* VNAV now deactivates upon reaching the last constraint (cyan altitude in FPL) prior to a VNAV ineligible leg, such as a MANSEQ, Procedure Turn or Hold. Be aware that if you have a MANSEQ leg at the end of your arrival procedure, without manual intervention, you can (and likely will) end up too high to reasonable descend for the approach. You have three options to navigate this: (1) Manually descend as is reasonable at your discretion; (2) delete the MANSEQ leg to allow VNAV to recalculate by directly connecting the end of the arrival with the beginning of the approach or (3) activate the approach (or proceed direct to the IAF) and VNAV will attempt to calculate a path up to 6 degrees from your current position to the next constraint.
* GPS, LOC, and VOR modes now ARM! Be aware that you will need to be on an intercept course and within capture distance of the desired flight path before those modes will become active.
* The GPS flight plan sequencing will enter SUSP under the following conditions: when reaching a manual termination leg (holds, manual sequence) and when reaching the final leg of the plan. This is actually correct behavior. To exit out of SUSP (for example, if you got to the end of a plan and then loaded more waypoints), hit the SUSP softkey in the middle of the PFD.
* Changing the CDI source drops the autopilot into ROL mode. This is the correct behavior, intended to keep the airplane held in the same attitude until the pilot reselects appropriate guidance.
* When exiting a hold, do not delete the HOLD as it will cause flight plan issues. Press the SUSP key to continue with the flight plan sequence or go direct to another fix.
* The NXiâ€™s traffic advisory system (TAS) will now start in STANDBY mode by default. While in this mode it will not issue any advisories nor will traffic be displayed on any maps. The system will automatically switch from STANDBY to OPERATING mode after takeoff (and back to STANDBY after landing). You can also manually switch TAS to OPERATING mode through the MFD Traffic Map page (use the MFD FMS knobs to change the open MFD page).
* The fuel quantity information on the MFD's sytem page simulates an authentic totalizer. This means it does not actually track the fuel in your tanks, it simply counts how much has been burned and relies on you to tell it what the original quantity was. This means if you add or remove fuel in flight you'll need to manually adjust the starting quantity in the tanks with the buttons on the GAL REM submenu.
* The displayed METAR information on the MFD FPL page reflects real-world weather, so they may not always match in-game conditions, especially if using a weather preset or custom weather.

## Known Issues
* Sometimes the flight plan loading from the world map screen is loaded incompletely; this can usually be solved by restarting the flight - we are working on nailing this down.
* World Map imports from Navigraph and Simbrief do not include airways, so airways will not be added to the G1000 NXi flight plan when the plan was imported to the World Map from one of these sources.
