# Working Title G1000 NXi
Welcome to the Early Access Beta of the Working Title G1000 NXi for [Microsoft Flight Simulator](https://flightsimulator.com).<br>

This package replaces the stock G1000 in planes that use that panel package with a new G1000 NXi, written from the ground up by Working Title Simulations.

This is an early access beta and there are many features of the real-world unit that have not yet been implemented, and you will surely find more than a few bugs here and there. It is our intention to keep a cadence of weekly or bi-weekly updates for this package, so we will be quickly adding features as well as squashing bugs that our wider open-beta audience help identify.

Let’s reiterate – this is an early-access beta, released with the intent to help find bugs with the existing code as quickly as possible – if you find that it doesn’t work well for you, simply uninstall the package and use the default G1000 instrument.

    <h4>Attention!</h4>
    This package is exclusively offered via the ingame Marketplace – go there to download the latest version.<br>
    Because of the update cadence, we will maintain the dedicated changelog for each update here on the packages.workingtitle.aero site.

## What's next?
We will be updating this package on a weekly/bi-weekly basis, and we will announce on our discord server, and here, when a new package version is available for download. We will be focusing on adding depth to many of the systems, as well as squashing bugs found by our open beta audience.


## Bug Reporting
We are asking everyone that downloads this package to help us make it better. You can do that by logging genuine bugs with the features we’ve implemented in our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/Fa6w2xK) server in the dedicated #g1000-nxi-issues channel.

But…we need your help to make this work – we do NOT need you to report missing features. We have the manual, we have the official Garmin trainer, we have real-world NXi examples, so we know what features we haven’t implemented. What we NEED is to know about bugs that you encounter with the features we HAVE implemented. Please, please, please limit your feedback to bugs, issues or problems you encounter with existing features. Thanks!
