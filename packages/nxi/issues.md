<div class="accordion accordion-flush mb-4" id="accordion">

<h3>NavMap</h3>
{% capture issue %}
Using the scroll knobs to enter waypoints is hard. Can I use my keyboard?
{% endcapture %}
{% capture answer %}
Yes, there's a keyboard input option on the waypoint info page. Click on the input field, or the little keyboard image to activate keyboard entry. Remember to disable that because it captures all inputs and you won't be able press any buttons while keyboard entry is active.
