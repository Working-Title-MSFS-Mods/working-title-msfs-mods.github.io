<h3>Development Roles</h3>

{% capture jobtitle %}
## Software Developer
{% endcapture %}
{% capture jobdetails %}
The Software Developer helps build Working Title’s avionics and systems simulation software. You will have the opportunity to participate in the full lifecycle of development projects, from the design phase to completion, under the mentorship of our senior or lead developers. The primary tech stack for most projects will be JavaScript/HTML/CSS, but there may be some opportunities for development in C++ as well. Our software must operate with minimal impact on simulator performance, so prior experience with optimization or development for constrained systems would be a big plus.
