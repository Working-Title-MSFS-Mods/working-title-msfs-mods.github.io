# Working Title CJ4 v0.7.2

Welcome to the latest update of the Working Title CJ4 (v0.7.2). 
This is a hotfix for v0.7.1 for some compatibility changes after MSFS update 1.11.6.0! Thanks to all the helpful folks who contributed to this release.

## Important Feature Change from v0.7.0 Onward

The active flight plan route will no longer be displayed in the ARC or ROSE modes. This is accurate to the actual aircraft. The ARC and ROSE modes are designed to work with the course pointer system. If you would like to see the flight plan route, you must use the PPOS display mode (very similar to ARC, except with the active flight plan instead of pointers) or the PLAN mode.

To activate the new altitude select range indicator (altitude banana), press DSPL MENU on the FMC, then go to page 2. Press LSK3L to activate the indicator. The indicator will only be displayed in the PPOS mode.

## Installation
Installation is easy, simply copy the `workingtitle-aircraft-cj4` folder inside the zip file to your MSFS Community folder. 

**Important: We recommend that you fully delete the previous `workingtitle-aircraft-cj4` folder before copying this release.**

## Changes
* Fixed SimBrief import for compatibility with 1.11.6.0
* Fixed Mach Hold not synchronizing with mach changes

## Known Issues
* Altitude constraints are not currently selectable on the map due to incorrect data being displayed.
* The speed constraints on arrivals may not show correctly because of database issues.
* After using Direct-To, the navigation will not always automatically sequence to the next fix and may enter ROL mode. You can re-activate NAV to navigate to the next fix if you encounter this issue.
* The aircraft is still using the built-in MSFS autopilot (for now). All the existing limitations of that still apply. It does behave a bit better with the various enhancements applied.
* Some flight plan distances may still be misreported when the approach is activated. Please log an issue if you encounter this with details.
* Some instances of the autopilot skipping approach waypoints still occur - this is deep in the sim handling of waypoints and is, for now, out of our hands. We will continue to research this.
