# Working Title G3000 v0.4.1
## Changes in this version
- Added mod configuration file.
- Added road display for the navigation map (requires the optional `workingtitle-g3000-roaddata` package).

**Fixes**
- \[General\] Fixed performance degradation over time.

### Configuration File
Certain mod settings can be customized via a configuration file which is located at `workingtitle-g3000\html_ui\WTg3000.cfg`. Documentation for the various settings can be found in the file itself. If you make changes to the file while the game is running, you must restart the game for the changes to take effect.
